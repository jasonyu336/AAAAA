BST:       
During building, every time an element was added, perform search and self-adjust. Extra steps potentially increase runtime, but if data contains many duplicates, will
help boost performance in long run.

Cycle detection:    
When perform DFS, add a "tree-like" stack and push before iterating children and pop after iteration. 

Locating Cycles:   

           
#### Goal(or is it even possible?)  

We want to reduce overheads for BST ops, so is it possible to build such a BST, or at least 'sub-optimal' BST, 
as a complete tree structure?
